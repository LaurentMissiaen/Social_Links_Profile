## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First time using focus states, enabling users to use keyboard to focus on interactive elements.
Really thought about correctly using heading tags.
Put a lot of effort in optimizing color palette for readability.

### Continued development

Started with a desktop-first workflow, caught myself, then switched to a mobile-first approach.
Writing down my plan before starting a project would help, make the proces smoother and avoid
wasting time.
